# Contributing

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/catalystsoftworks/unreal-community-wiki/issues) is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.

Guidelines for bug reports:

1.  **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been reported.
2.  **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the latest `main` or development branch in the repository.
3.  **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a [reduced test case](https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/) and a live example.
4.  **Use the bug report template** &mdash; please fill in the template which appears when you open a new issue.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser(s) and OS experience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

Example:

> ## Description
> A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being
> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).
>
> ## Steps to reproduce
> Steps to reproduce the behavior:
>
> 1.  This is the first step
> 2.  This is the second step
> 3.  Further steps, etc.
>
> **Expected behavior**
> A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.
>
> **Screenshots**
> If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
>
> ## Versions
>
> - OS: [e.g. iOS 11, Windows 10]
> - Browser: [e.g. chrome, safari]
> - Version: [e.g. 22]

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as many details and as much context as possible.

There is also a template for feature requests. Please make sure to use it.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - can be a big help in making this project more useful for others. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's maintainers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).

The `main` branch is for the latest version of the project and is used for production deployments.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project and clone it to your local machine.
2. Create a new topic branch (off the `main` branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix.
3. Commit your changes in logical chunks and please use descriptive commit messages using the past tense.
4. Locally merge the upstream `main` branch into your topic branch.
5. Push your topic branch up to your fork.
6. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to license your work under the terms of the [AGPL-3.0 License](./LICENSE.md).
